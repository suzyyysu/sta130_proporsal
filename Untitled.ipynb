    "### 1. Research Question One\n",
    "Is there a RELATIONSHIP between LGBTQ2+ identity and social loneliness?\n",
    "### 2. Variables\n",
    "- **Grouping Variable (Independent Variable):** `DEMO_identity_lgbtq` — Categorical （binary）variable reflecting if an individual identifies as LGBTQ2+ (`Sexual or gender minorities`) or `Not Selected`.\n",
    "- **Outcome Variable (Dependent Variable):** `LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_score_y_n` — Categorical variable indicating whether an individual reports emotional and social loneliness (`yes` or `no`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Analysis (Chi-square test of independence)\n",
    "- **Chi-square Test of Independence**: By comparing the observed data with expected counts (assuming no association), the test helps identify if LGBTQ2+ individuals experience different levels of loneliness than non-LGBTQ2+ individuals. \n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate the proportion of individuals reporting loneliness within each group (LGBTQ2+ vs. non-LGBTQ2+) to summarize and compare loneliness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Visualizations\n",
    "- **Bar Chart**: Display the distribution of loneliness responses (\"yes\" or \"no\") within LGBTQ2+ and non-LGBTQ2+ groups.\n",
    "- **Stacked Bar Chart**: To show the relative proportions of loneliness within each LGBTQ2+ status category for a clear comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Assumptions\n",
    "- **Independence of Observations**: Each individual’s LGBTQ2+ identity and loneliness response should be independent of others.\n",
    "- **Expected Frequencies**: The chi-square test requires that each cell in the contingency table has an expected frequency of at least 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no association between LGBTQ2+ identity and reported social loneliness.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant association between LGBTQ2+ identity and reported social loneliness."

    "- **Independent Variable (Categorical): `DEMO_disability_communication` — Indicates whether an individual has a communication disability.\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable (Categorical): `Mental health disability (including depression)` — Indicates whether an individual has a mental health disability, such as depression.\n",
    "### 3. Analysis\n",
    "- **Chi-square Test of Independence**: This test will assess whether the distribution of mental health disability (yes/no) differs significantly between individuals with and without a communication disability.\n",

    "- **Bar Chart**: Display the distribution of mental health disability responses (\"yes\" or \"no\") within the groups of individuals with and without a communication disability.\n",

    "### 4. Visualizations\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot:** To visualize the relationship between body image negative affect scores and social dependence scores.\n",
